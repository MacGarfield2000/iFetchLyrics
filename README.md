iFetchLyrics
======

iFetchLyrics can automatically fetch the lyrics for  songs in your iTunes music library. You can fetch lyrics for all songs in a playlist of your choice at once. The fetched lyrics are stored directly in the music files and are then permanently available in iTunes and for other apps.

**System Requirements:** iFetchLyrics requires Mac OS X 10.8, iTunes and an active internet connection
  
**Accuracy Info:** Note that fetching lyrics depends on accurate title and artist information. If your music is not properly 'tagged', consider using a tool like '[MusicBrainz Picard](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Picard)' to automatically correct this information for all your music tracks.
