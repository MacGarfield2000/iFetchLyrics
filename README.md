iFetchLyrics
======

iFetchLyrics can automatically fetch the lyrics for  songs in your iTunes music library. You can fetch lyrics for all songs in a playlist of your choice at once. The fetched lyrics are stored directly in the music files and are then permanently available in iTunes and for other apps.

**System Requirements:** iFetchLyrics requires Mac OS X 10.7, iTunes and an active internet connection
  
**Accuracy Info:** Note that fetching lyrics depends on accurate title and artist information. If your music is not properly 'tagged', consider using a tool like '[MusicBrainz Picard](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Picard)' to automatically correct this information for all your music tracks.

**Legal Info:** Note that depending on your home country, fetching lyrics may only be legal for music you have legally purchased, or it not be legal at all. Before continuing make sure you have: 

1. permissions from music copyright holders to fetch lyrics for your music
2. permissions from [lyrics.wikia.com](http://http://lyrics.wikia.com/Lyrics_Wiki), [lyrics.n7.pl](http://lyrics.n7.pl), [metrolyrics.com](http://www.metrolyrics.com) and [lyricsall.com](http://lyricsall.com) to fetch lyrics from their websites
